# 👋 Hi, I'm Leo Lee

💻 Full Stack Developer based in Adelaide, Australia.  
I enjoy turning ideas into real, working products — from front-end interfaces to back-end logic.  

🚀 My main stack includes React, Next.js, Node.js, NestJS, and MongoDB, and I'm also exploring some AI-related technologies.
